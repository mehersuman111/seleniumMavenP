Automation framework is Where we organize automation project files/folders in structured manner.

Files like Testcases, Page Object Classes, Properties file, Utility files, test data files, reports files, XML files, screenshots. To organize the file in a structured manner we need an automation framework.

Objectives: -
1) Re-Usubility
2) Maintanability
3) Readability

Types of Framework: -
1) Built-In
		Ex- TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, Robot etc.
		
2) Customized(User Defined)
		Ex- Modular Framework, Data Driven, Keyword Driven, Hybride Driven etc.

Phases/Stages
-------------
1) Analysing the AUT

		- Findout the number of pages
		- What are all elements and What type of elements i.e., Customized or Built-In
		- What to automate / What we can not automate
		
2) Choose testcases for automation
		
		If we have 100 TCs with the AUT, the it's not possible to automate the entire project.
		And if we have 90 Automatable TCs and 10 Not Automatable TCs, then It's possible to achieve 100% automation for only automatable TCs.
		Also we have to prioritize our TCs.
			1) Sanity Cases - P1
			2) Data Driver TCs/Retest - P2
			3) Regression TCs - P3
			4) Any other cases - P4
		
3) Design and Development of Framework

4) Execution - 
		
		Local, Remotely

5) Maintenance

		- Local Repositary
		- Global/Remote Repositary
